# heart_disease_analysis

## Selected topic
We want to study how body conditions(blood sugar, heart rate, etc.) relate to the heart disease. Using some known information, we will try to build models and predict if a person would get heart diease.

## Reason they selected the topic
It's important for people to identify and manage heart disease risk factors. Learning this, we can give people healthy suggestions to minimize the risk and position ourselves for long and happy lives. Besides, we can also find the potential patients, then we can get treated earlier.

## Description of the source of data

age

sex

cp = chest pain type (4 values)

trestbps = resting blood pressure

chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

thalach = maximum heart rate achieved

exang = exercise induced angina

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

thal: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect


## Questions we hope to answer with the data

 - What variables are the most relevant
 - how to predict the target given specific information
 - healthy suggestions for people
