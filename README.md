# heart_disease_analysis

## Selected topic
We want to study how body conditions relate to the heart disease. Using some known information, we will try to build models and predict if a person would get heart diease.

## Reason they selected the topic
Learning this can help us find the potential patients, then we can get treated earlier.

## Description of the source of data

age

sex

cp = chest pain type (4 values)

trestbps = resting blood pressure

chol = serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

thalach = maximum heart rate achieved

exang = exercise induced angina

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

thal: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect


## Questions we hope to answer with the data

 - What variables are the most relevant
 - how to predict the target given specific information
