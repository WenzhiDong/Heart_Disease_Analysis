age

sex

trestbps = resting blood pressure

fbs = fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

slope = the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

thal: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect


## Questions they hope to answer with the data

 - What variables are the most relevant?
 - how to predict the target given specific variables
