## Description of the communication protocols

There are only two people in the team, Jingzhi and me. We are good friends, since we studied at the same university and worked together a lot, so it is easy for us to coordinate with each other. 

We would talk through Wechat, which is a Chinese  messaging and social media app.
We meet online twice a week:
 - 9pm to 11pm Tuesday 
 - 9pm to 11pm Friday 

### Assignment of tasks

Wenzhi Dong is responsible for presentation part and maching learning part.
